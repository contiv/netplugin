# Contiv installation for Kubernetes

This document details the setup instructions for Kubernetes version 1.6+ and higher for CentOS 7

Install kubernetes 1.6 or higher using http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/ and follow the instructions below.

### Install Contiv
* For ACI setups use contiv/contiv_aci.yaml instead of contiv/contiv.yaml.
* Replace all instances of `__NETMASTER_IP__` in contiv/contiv.yaml with the master IP.
* Replace `__VLAN_IF__` with the data plane interface.
  If there is no requirement to create vlan based networks there is no need for a seperate data interface and `__VLAN_IF__` can be set to "". If vlan based networks are to be created then a separate data interface is mandatory which can be set appropriately.
* Optional: Replace the contiv version(1.1.7) with the desired release/test version.
* Optional ACI only steps:
  - Replace __APIC_xxx__ fields with their corresponding values.
  - Default value for __APIC_EPG_BRIDGE_DOMAIN__  is "not_specified"
  - Default value for __APIC_CONTRACTS_UNRESTRICTED_MODE__ is "no"
  - Password based authentication: When using password based authentication, APIC_CERT_DN fields must be deleted.
  - Certificate based authentication:
    - When using certificate based authentication, APIC_PASSWORD can be empty.
    - Copy the certificate to a file named aci.key.
    - Create a secret by running the following on the management node
    ```sh
    kubectl create secret generic aci.key --from-file=<path name of aci.key file> -n kube-system
    ```
* On the management node, run
```sh
kubectl apply -f contiv.yaml
```
* Get netctl from a Contiv release or local build. Contiv releases are available from https://github.com/contiv/netplugin/releases
* Optional step to set the routing mode:
```sh
netctl global set --fwd-mode routing
```
* Optional ACI only step to set a VLAN range:
```sh
netctl global set --fabric-mode aci --vlan-range <start>-<end>
```
For example,
```sh
netctl global set --fabric-mode aci --vlan-range 1150-1170
```

### Using Contiv

* On the managment node, create the default network and EPG. For example, a vxlan network can be created as follows:
```sh
netctl net create -t default --subnet=20.1.1.0/24 default-net
netctl group create -t default default-net default-epg
```

* When in vxlan mode, delete the kube-dns deployment as follows:
```sh
kubectl delete deployment/kube-dns -n kube-system
```

Note: netctl uses "netmaster" as the default netmaster host. So add a reference for "netmaster" in /etc/hosts or explicitly specify it as a parameter to all netctl calls.

See https://github.com/contiv/netplugin/tree/master/mgmtfn/k8splugin for some examples on how to use Contiv networking with your pods.

### Uninstall Contiv
* Cleanup contiv pods
```sh
kubectl delete -f contiv.yaml
```
* Cleanup etcd data
```sh
rm -rf /var/etcd/contiv-data
```

### Troubleshooting Contiv Installation

* Check that netmaster, netplugin are running.
```sh
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
* Check the netmaster, netplugin logs to see if there are any errors.
```sh
cd /var/contiv/log
cat netmaster.log or netplugin.log
```
